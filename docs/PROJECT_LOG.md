# StockScout Next — Persistent Project Log

This file is the durable handoff for future agents. Update it after every meaningful code/workflow change. Keep entries concise and factual.

## 2026-08-20 — Project bootstrap

**Baseline**
- New standalone repo imported from `Garrincha077/stock-screener2`.
- Imported `main` matched stable production commit `ff2484303d1954480265c348c7be74126409e338`, which followed the successful Full Validation run and fresh post-market scan.
- `StockScreener-next` is development; `stock-screener2` remains production/stable fallback.

**Workflow isolation**
- Commit `fc0ead00d69c0be46c54702c19586d2646e68ed1` removed only the scheduled cron trigger from `.github/workflows/daily_screening_git_storage.yml`.
- Manual `workflow_dispatch` and reusable `workflow_call` remain available.
- No scan/scoring steps were changed by this isolation change.

**Governance / roadmap**
- Added `docs/STOCKSCOUT_NEXT_ROADMAP.md`.
- Added `docs/STOCKSCOUT_NEXT_GUARDRAILS.md`.
- Added executable core-invariance audit `audit_next_core_invariance.py` and tests for append-only/shadow development.
- Created `next-dev` for experimental work.

**Architecture decision**
- StockScout Core stays authoritative for Opportunity v2 / Emerging / MA Cluster / Groups / Fundamentals / RS / Stage.
- Original/LEGACY remains frozen.
- First major Next feature should be a read-only `legacyConfirmation` shadow adapter. It must not change Opportunity or other core scores.

**Next logical step**
- Implement the LEGACY Confirmation shadow layer on `next-dev`, with explicit invariance tests before UI integration.

## 2026-08-20 — LEGACY shadow adapter foundation

**Branch / commits**
- Branch: `next-dev`.
- Adapter: `7b93210bf50ada5156251f5a267521cb18b46800`.
- Tests: `c99346586728cdaffec1f36908425c255d5910b2`.

**What changed / why**
- Added `compute_legacy_confirmation.py` as a pure read-only adapter for already-observed frozen LEGACY output.
- The adapter normalizes only the approved shadow statuses `CONFIRMED`, `EARLY`, `NEUTRAL`, `CONFLICT`, `RISK`; missing or unknown status stays `UNAVAILABLE` rather than being reconstructed.
- Added explicit `observed` / `unavailable` provenance and append-only `legacyConfirmation` attachment to a deep-copied StockScout candidate.

**Affected files / components**
- `compute_legacy_confirmation.py`.
- `tests/test_compute_legacy_confirmation.py`.
- No scanner, canonical data writer, workflow, frontend, scoring module or frozen LEGACY source was wired or modified.

**Scoring / behavior impact**
- No StockScout Core scoring, ranking, buckets, Stage, RS or chart mapping changed.
- No runtime scan behavior changed; this is an isolated foundation for shadow-mode integration.

**Tests / audits / CI**
- Targeted local pytest against the committed adapter/test logic: `5 passed`.
- Coverage includes unavailable LEGACY, observed normalization, no status invention, no candidate mutation and compatibility with `compare_payloads()` core-invariance contract.
- Full Validation not run because this change does not touch scan/data/workflow runtime paths.
- No GitHub Actions run was available for commit `c99346586728cdaffec1f36908425c255d5910b2`; CI therefore is not claimed green.

**Risk / decision**
- The adapter intentionally does not infer LEGACY status from raw evidence yet; doing so before mapping the frozen observed fields would risk silently creating a new methodology.
- `stock-screener2` was not modified and Next nightly scheduling remains disabled.

**Next logical step**
- Map the actual already-captured frozen LEGACY fields into this adapter, then run the adapter against a canonical payload in shadow mode and verify exact before/after core invariance before any UI badge/filter wiring.

## 2026-08-20 — Captured LEGACY mapping + canonical shadow invariance gate

**Branch / commits**
- Branch: `next-dev`.
- Captured-output classifier: `ddd29e5429dc44cb7df119113f8e5e1bfa38604d`.
- Expanded regression tests: `56b3df25938f845ed33b6fe5b74369c856f006a1`.
- Read-only canonical audit: `2c33403783e16bc6add7efc940c2e2afee6fdb91`.
- Compact persistence refactor: `8990ae9d84d960badb13f203111e670e1f24078e`.

**What changed / why**
- Mapped the confirmation layer to already-captured frozen outputs under `originalEngine` and the flat `original*` fields; no frozen LEGACY function or threshold was modified.
- Added deterministic non-numeric status precedence: emitted original SELL -> `RISK`; emitted original BUY -> `CONFIRMED`; raw original BUY/SELL not emitted -> `CONFLICT`; frozen Trend Template/VCP/breakout booleans -> `EARLY`; otherwise captured rows -> `NEUTRAL`; missing capture -> `UNAVAILABLE`.
- Detailed in-memory evidence exposes original market gate, Minervini TT, VCP contraction anatomy, A/D volume, breakout, original R/R/risk and SELL/failed-breakout evidence.
- Persistable `legacyConfirmation` is intentionally compact and points back to `market.originalSignalGate` / `originalEngine` instead of duplicating the full evidence tree.
- Added `audit_legacy_confirmation_shadow.py`, which enriches only in memory and fails on any protected StockScout or chart-mapping drift.

**Affected files / components**
- `compute_legacy_confirmation.py`.
- `tests/test_compute_legacy_confirmation.py`.
- `audit_legacy_confirmation_shadow.py`.
- No scanner, canonical writer, frontend, workflow or frozen LEGACY source was changed.

**Scoring / behavior impact**
- `legacyConfirmation` remains shadow-only and explicitly carries `affectsStockScout: false`.
- No Opportunity v2, Emerging Leader, MA Cluster, Group Leadership, Fundamentals, Stage, RS, default rank or chart mapping was changed.
- Canonical `frontend/public/data/latest.json` was not written or committed by this work.

**Tests / audits / CI**
- Targeted local pytest after captured-field mapping: `15 passed`.
- Read-only audit was run against the real GitHub Pages snapshot produced by successful Stable Full Validation run `32314809594` (head SHA `fa2739c5463739389c05a7479d859063729a328c`, generatedAt `2026-08-19T23:57:38.758884+00:00`).
- Snapshot: 2,013 universe rows; frozen LEGACY complete-source coverage 2,013/2,013; capture errors 0; original-run BUY 620; original-run SELL 173.
- Shadow result: `CONFIRMED 620`, `EARLY 236`, `NEUTRAL 984`, `RISK 173`, `CONFLICT 0`, `UNAVAILABLE 0`.
- Core-invariance errors: `0`; chart shard mapping identical; source payload remained unchanged in memory.
- Compact append-only serialization estimate: +0.884 MB (~2.14%) versus +3.48 MB for duplicated detailed evidence.
- This was not a fresh Full Validation run of the new adapter code; CI is therefore not claimed green.

**Risk / decision**
- Do not persist duplicated detailed evidence into the already-large canonical payload; reuse existing `originalEngine` as the drill-down source.
- Keep confirmation classification boolean/emission-based. No new composite score or threshold calibration was introduced.
- Stable was only read via its successful Pages artifact; `stock-screener2` was not modified. Next nightly scheduling remains disabled.

**Next logical step**
- Materialize the compact confirmation as a separate reversible shadow artifact/sidecar (preferred over inflating canonical `latest.json`), validate it against the same canonical input, then wire one read-only badge/filter in the frontend before broader Phase 4 UX work.
